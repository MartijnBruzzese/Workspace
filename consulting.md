# UCSF Consulting — Ethical Systems Design

Designing consent-centered, safety-first systems for responsible AI.

I provide independent consulting on consent-centered system design, safety architecture, and ethical infrastructure for AI and digital platforms.

My work focuses on translating ethical principles into operational design choices — not policy documents, but systems that behave responsibly by default.

This includes:

- Consent-first interaction design  
- Safety-by-architecture (fail-closed systems, sandboxes, risk classes)  
- Protection of vulnerable subjects through structural safeguards  
- Intent-aware system flows  
- Ethical foundations for creative and generative platforms  
- Framework development for early-stage products and research initiatives  

My approach is grounded in the Universal Consent & Safety Framework (UCSF), with ModelHaven Studio serving as its applied implementation layer.
