# Martijn Bruzzese — Workspace

Personal workspace for hospitality profile, creative writing, and UCSF framework development.

This repository serves as my public working space: a living archive of professional experience, creative work, and independent framework development.

## About

I’m a Senior Hospitality Professional with 20+ years of experience in bar and service environments, alongside ongoing work in creative writing and independent AI ethics / safety frameworks.

This workspace brings those threads together.

Not polished products — active work.
